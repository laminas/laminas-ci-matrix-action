      JSON object for use as a job matrix. It contains the element "include",
      which in turn defines the four elements "name" (a string representing the
      job name), "job" (a JSON string representing the job to run),
      "operating-system" (for use with the "runs-on" property of the job), and
      "action" (the name of the container to use to run the job). It can also
      optionally contain the element "exclude" with a list of objects indicating
      jobs that should not be run (based on partial or full match of elements in
      a job).
